First you need to test your machine supports hibernation. Test it with the command:

 sudo pm-hibernate
 # or for newer Ubuntus like 17.04
 sudo systemctl hibernate

The system will try to hibernate. If you are able to start the system again then you are more or less safe to add an override.


Ubuntu 16.04 and above
----------------------

For enabling in the interface you'll need to run sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla and fill with:

[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate
ResultActive=yes

[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate;org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-multiple-sessions
ResultActive=yes

Save by pressing 'Ctrl-O' then 'Enter' and then exit nano by pressing 'Ctrl-X'.

Restart and hibernation is back!

Or run "killall unity-panel-service" to just reset the (upper right) power menu.
