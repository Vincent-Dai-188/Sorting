In Ubuntu we will need to install gcc, make, and the zlib compression / decompression library:

# apt -y install gcc make zlib1g-dev

To install Python 3.6, run the following commands:

# wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/Python-3.6.0.tar.xz
# tar xJf Python-3.6.0.tar.xz
# cd Python-3.6.0
# ./configure
# make
# make install

Now relax and go grab a sandwich because this may take a while. When the installation is complete, use which to verify the location of the main binary:

# which python3
# python3 -V

The output of the above command should be similar to:
Python 3.6.0
